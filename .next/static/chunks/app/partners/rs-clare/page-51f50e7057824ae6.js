The produced gas and fluids contain small concentrations of H2S, CO2 and chlorides. The Xmas trees are a combination of Cameron, FMC & Kvaerner 5K and 10K Y-blocks. The SI pressures are less than 20% of the equipment ratings. Over the years a maintenance program was implemented to ensure the X-mas trees were greased on a regular basis (every 6 months) with 'standard grease' as recommended. Issues arose when trying to establish barriers for intervention work as per SPDC policy on the aging Xmas tree valves. SPDC CSR found that the only way to achieve the required barriers was to have a Sealant crew work on the Xmas tree valves just prior to performing the intervention (usually the same day) and keep the crew on location in case they were needed. During the 'grease investigation period' SPDC started a CT STOG (Coil Tubing Intervention) program where barriers were required almost on a daily basis. Once they started using Valve Sealant 701 they found that they no longer needed to grease the Xmas tree valves afterwards, in fact we could grease it two weeks prior and still achieve the required barriers. During CT Well Intervention operations, they also no longer had to keep grease and pumping equipment on location and rarely had to grease the X-mas tree during operations. Due to the excellent performance of Valve Sealant 701, management decided to switch to Valve Sealant 701 throughout the field. Huge cost savings have been delivered as a result, and SPDC continue to use VL/VS 601/701 in this field and many more regions across the globe.
